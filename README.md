###README for course project _Getting and Cleaning Data_

the run_analysis.R file in this repo converts the unzipped data from the following location
into a tidy tall data set. The output is called tidy_data.txt

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The data represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

The run_analysis.R script assumes that the zip file is extracted in your R working directory
and that the folder structure is unchanged.

Please refer to the CodeBook for more details about the transformation and the data.
